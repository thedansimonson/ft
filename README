# Free Tables: A Conduit for the Magic of Python #

##################################################

Python data types are awesome. You can do pretty much anything with them.
One particularly useful arrangement is a list of dictionaries, something
I started referring to as a "free table."

This is a library for manipulating free tables.

################# Setup
    $ sudo python setup.py install

That's it really. Python's pretty rad. Future versions may be a little more 
complicated.

################# Conventions
data: If an argument is called data, a free table is expected there.

datum/point: A dictionary of a free table. 

dex: If an argument is called dex, then it should be a dex--a dictionary
whose values are free tables. These are what indexBy returns. 

prop: If an argument is called prop, it's a property. This usually should
be an entry in every datum in data. It isn't always, sometimes intended for
retaining consistency. 

################# FAQ
+ Why don't you make an ftable class?
    No. That defeats the whole point of free tables. They're supposed to be
    pliable and easily manipulable using Python syntax. They're a convention,
    not a type. I only see the imposition of a class upon the structure as
    a hinderance.

    Additionally, free tables are the gestation of a larger movement towards 
    a classless society free of bourgeoisie oppression. This is because 
    algorithms are ideology. Power to the people.

    If you think I'm wrong, you're welcome to prove me so.


################# Official To-Do/Bugs List

Bugs:
    + load_csv is a half-baked implementation. No quote support.

To-Do/Ideas (No Particular Order):
    + multidex seems to be superslow--optimizations required.
    + validate
    + a version of validate that doesn't raise an error, but instead
        just returns naughty and nice lists.
    + fill_defaults
        - given a default entry, it fills each data point that lacks
            a key in default with the kv pair in the default.
    + dump_csv
        - both load_csv and dump_csv need to be totally written to handle
            dialects more formally
    + load_json, dump_json - I don't use json enough for this, but it's easy.
    + indexBy4's performance really dragged once pipe was fixed. Further
        optimizations: change pipe's default from lambda x: x to False and
        create two cases.
    + mv(("x","y"), [{"x":...}, ...]) -> [{"y":...}, ...]
    + has - remove values that don't have property
    + fulldex: build a dex of every value available. crazy? absolutely.
    + kmap(data, k, f)
        d[k] = f(d[k])
    + tag is so useful, but it's hideous. why is it so wrong? 
        - too expressive, perhaps
