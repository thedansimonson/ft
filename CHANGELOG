# 1.0.0:
    * Python 3 support.
    * CHANGELOG created. It's markdown.

# 0.2.7:
    * speed boost (probably) for multidex (removed "sum(...,[])")

# 0.2.5 - 0.2.6: 
    * ???
    * multidex
    * shoulda had better verison notes here, sorry.

# 0.2.4:
    * flatdex 
        * dex entries with one member are turned into the dex dictionary values.
            {1: [{"x":1}]} -> {1: {"x":1}}
        * force = False
            * if IS True, it grabs the first entry of each list

# 0.2.3:
    * indexBy0 wins the optimization war. Removed alternatives.
    * Added index, which swaps the arguments of indexBy
    * singletons("label", [1,2,3]) -> [{"label": 1}, {"label": 2}, ...]
    * removed pprint statement from merge

# 0.2.2:
    * There's load_csv and dump_csv functions now, but they are crap. They work.
        But they're crap.
    * This fixes the ";" bug from earlier versions.

# 0.2.1: 
    * version number is now a string so I can support multiple "."s

# 0.21:
    * indexBy4: ACTUALLY fixed pipe arg. The last fix was sloppy.
    * indexBy0 is now the winner again, so that's the default now.

# 0.2:
    * Finished tag.
    * Added merge.
    * Cancelled pickle_load/pickle_dump.
    * Cancelled transformAllTo (what was it supposed to do?)
    * indexBy4: pipe arg fixed--may not work properly on others

# 0.1: 
    * First test version
    * indexBy0, indexBy1, indexBy2, indexBy3, indexBy4 added.
    * indexBy4 selected as optimal. Performances:
        * <function indexBy0 at 0xf6e500> 0.00283553865387
        * <function indexBy2 at 0xf6e6e0> 0.00355636643664
        * <function indexBy3 at 0xf6e758> 0.0116692264226
        * <function indexBy4 at 0xf6e5f0> 0.00204977947795
    * meta functions 
        * Added: 
            * future: raises an exception when a planned function is called.
        * Planned:
            * validate
    * Manipulation functions 
        * Added: 
            * histo: turns a dex into a histogram (dictionary with number values)
            * summary: performs histo on each possible key
        * Planned:
            * tag
            * transformAllTo
    * Hello and Goodbye functions
        * Planned:
            * pickle_load, pickle_dump
            * dump_csv
            * load_json, dump_json
        * Added:
            * load_csv: turns a csv into a free table
